                        <br><p>This is a series of letters to one Zovot Crown from the legendary Alexander Rublif. The letters denote Mr. Robluf's time in acidemia while doing his thesis work. It is currently unknown who Mx. Crown may be due to their lack of existence in any other contemporary literature or in Mr.Robluf's autobiography, but by the writings it appears that the two were for some time close. </p>

                        <p>The Fumus Library is a semi-private collection of books, novels, letters, and unpublished works where people are encouraged to come and share their stories.  The collection is owned by Mx. Mauve Coronet and spans 500 years of literature: from play books to VHS recordings. 
                         We buy, sell, and trade rare books but anyone is free to come in and look at the collection. Our mission statement is not to hoard knowledge but to share it freely.  .  This is why this website was created- to share the words of people whose voices may not have been heard before.  
                         <br><br>
                        Do you have a story you want to share, or want to speak with our curators? Contact us at fumuslibrary@gmail.com
