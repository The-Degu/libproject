                    <li>Facts</li>
                        <ul class="b">
                            <li>Vampirism comes from the parasite Vampirn Annelida. This magically-enhanced worm is most commonly found within bats, though it can be found within wolves, foxes, and other carnivorous mammals.</li>
                            <li>The parasite lives in the upper intestine, feeding off of the host’s blood and any iron, protein, and fats that pass by.</li>
                            <li>The parasite passes eggs through bites from the host animal, after inducing nausea and vomiting.</li>
                            <li>Most people with functioning immune systems are immune to the parasite, but those who are immunocompromised and are exposed to the parasite have a higher chance of becoming infected</li>
                            <li>If one is treated with metronidazole, iodoquinol, diloxanide furoate, paromomycin, chloroquine, or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole within a one-week period of being exposed have a 98% recovery rate. After a one-week period of exposure, the recovery rate by only using anti-parasitic agents drops to 34% after one year of infection full recovery and removal of all parasites to 11%.</li>
                            <li>It is highly illegal in most countries to purposely spread vampirism or to purposely infect yourself with the parasite.</li>
                            <li>Due to the way the infection spreads along with the heightened cravings for blood, there are many known cases of cannibalism by those infected by the parasite.</li>
                </ul>

                        <li>loss of libido</li>
                        <li><strong>Enthrallment 
                        </strong></li>
                        <ul class=c>
                            <li>This is a comorbid symptom of vampirism Only happens to 25-50% of those infected with the disease.</li>
                            <li>it is unknown what exactly causes enthrallment it is apparent that if the infecting vampire (from now on known as subject-A),  spends long periods of time with a specific non-infected individual (subject-B) before turning them, after turning them subject-b has a higher chance to become enthralled.</li>
                            <li>Subject-Bs the longer they spend with the subject-A become more dependant of subject-A. looking to them for approval for every action. Even basic survival actions, such as eating and sleeping have to be approved by a subject-A.  </li>
                            <li>There is no way to inverse enthrallment once it has started but if removed from any subject-As  it will halt any progression of the secondary effects</li>
                            <li>Inversely the Subject-A feels the need to protect and take care of any thralls. It has been compared to parental instincts along with increased sexual and romantic attraction.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Myths</li>
                    <br>
                    <ul class=b>
                        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Those who are infected with vampirism can only be killed by staking them through the heart.</li>
                        <li><strong>fact</strong> while those infected are less likely to die of blood loss or any given disease, but they can still die by any means that any other non-infected person could die.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Myth</strong>: Those who are infected with vampirism live off of human blood and crave it</li>
                        <li><strong>fact</strong>: many people infected do indeed crave blood but can subsite these cravings with powdered blood and fresh animal blood. Those who feed regularly are completely safe to be around.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Myth</strong>: Those who are infected are taken by the government never to be seen again.</li>
                        <li><strong>fact</strong>: Those who have passed the one-year threshold of the disease are sometimes offered to live in subsidized communities where they can come and go as they please but may be studied by medical professionals, and pharmaceutical companies.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Myth</strong>: infected people cannot go out into the sun or they will burst into flames</li>
                        <li><strong>fact</strong>: Vampires will not burst into flames if exposed to the sun. 5% of vampires are not sun-sensitive at all, and for most, it is close to an allergic reaction, and they burn much faster under sunlight if kept in the sun for a sustained period anaphylaxis can occur, and irreparable damage can happen to the dermis and epidermis leading to gangrene and/or loss of extremities.</li>
                        </ul>
