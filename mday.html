                            <li>Vampirism comes from the parasite Vampirn Annelida. This magically-enhanced worm is most commonly found within bats, though it can be found within wolves, foxes, and other carnivorous mammals.</li>
                            <li>The parasite lives in the upper intestine, feeding off of the host’s blood and any iron, protein, and fats that pass by.</li>
                            <li>The parasite passes eggs through bites from the host animal, after inducing nausea and vomiting.</li>
                            <li>Most people with functioning immune systems are immune to the parasite, but those who are immunocompromised and are exposed to the parasite have a higher chance of becoming infected</li>
                            <li>If one is treated with metronidazole, iodoquinol, diloxanide furoate, paromomycin, chloroquine, or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole within a one-week period of being exposed have a 98% recovery rate. After a one-week period of exposure, the recovery rate by only using anti-parasitic agents drops to 34% after one year of infection full recovery and removal of all parasites to 11%.</li>
                            <li>It is highly illegal in most countries to purposely spread vampirism or to purposely infect yourself with the parasite.</li>
                            <li>Due to the way the infection spreads along with the heightened cravings for blood, there are many known cases of cannibalism by those infected by the parasite.</li>
