                    <li>Facts</li>
                        <ul class="b">
                            <li>Vampirism comes from the parasite Vampirn Annelida. This magically-enhanced worm is most commonly found within bats, though it can be found within wolves, foxes, and other carnivorous mammals.</li>
                            <li>The parasite lives in the upper intestine, feeding off of the host’s blood and any iron, protein, and fats that pass by.</li>
                            <li>The parasite passes eggs through bites from the host animal, after inducing nausea and vomiting.</li>
                            <li>Most people with functioning immune systems are immune to the parasite, but those who are immunocompromised and are exposed to the parasite have a higher chance of becoming infected</li>
                            <li>If one is treated with metronidazole, iodoquinol, diloxanide furoate, paromomycin, chloroquine, or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole within a one-week period of being exposed have a 98% recovery rate. After a one-week period of exposure, the recovery rate by only using anti-parasitic agents drops to 34% after one year of infection full recovery and removal of all parasites to 11%.</li>
                            <li>It is highly illegal in most countries to purposely spread vampirism or to purposely infect yourself with the parasite.</li>
                            <li>Due to the way the infection spreads along with the heightened cravings for blood, there are many known cases of cannibalism by those infected by the parasite.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Symptoms</li>
                    <ul class=b>
                        <li>Lethargy</li>
                        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                        <li>Anemia</li>
                        <li>Cravings for raw meat and blood</li>
                        <li>Cold extremities</li>
                        <li>Slowing of the heart rate </li>
                        <li>Increased immune response to any contagion </li>
                        <li>faster healing and a higher clotting factor</li>
                        <li> Solar urticaria: hypersensitivity to sunlight</li>
                        <li>Slowed metabolism</li>
                        <li>Slowed aging</li>
                        <li>Periods of suspended animation lasting for two days up to six weeks</li>
                        <li>Impedance</li>
                        <li> sterilization </li>
                        <li>loss of libido</li>
                        <li><strong>Enthrallment 
                        </strong></li>
                        <ul class=c>
                            <li>This is a comorbid symptom of vampirism Only happens to 25-50% of those infected with the disease.</li>
                            <li>it is unknown what exactly causes enthrallment it is apparent that if the infecting vampire (from now on known as subject-A),  spends long periods of time with a specific non-infected individual (subject-B) before turning them, after turning them subject-b has a higher chance to become enthralled.</li>
                            <li>Subject-Bs the longer they spend with the subject-A become more dependant of subject-A. looking to them for approval for every action. Even basic survival actions, such as eating and sleeping have to be approved by a subject-A.  </li>
                            <li>There is no way to inverse enthrallment once it has started but if removed from any subject-As  it will halt any progression of the secondary effects</li>
                            <li>Inversely the Subject-A feels the need to protect and take care of any thralls. It has been compared to parental instincts along with increased sexual and romantic attraction.</li>

                    <li>Myths</li>
                    <br>
                    <ul class=b>
                        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Those who are infected with vampirism can only be killed by staking them through the heart.</li>
                        <li><strong>fact</strong> while those infected are less likely to die of blood loss or any given disease, but they can still die by any means that any other non-infected person could die.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Myth</strong>: Those who are infected with vampirism live off of human blood and crave it</li>
                        <li><strong>fact</strong>: many people infected do indeed crave blood but can subsite these cravings with powdered blood and fresh animal blood. Those who feed regularly are completely safe to be around.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Myth</strong>: Those who are infected are taken by the government never to be seen again.</li>
                        <li><strong>fact</strong>: Those who have passed the one-year threshold of the disease are sometimes offered to live in subsidized communities where they can come and go as they please but may be studied by medical professionals, and pharmaceutical companies.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Myth</strong>: infected people cannot go out into the sun or they will burst into flames</li>
                        <li><strong>fact</strong>: Vampires will not burst into flames if exposed to the sun. 5% of vampires are not sun-sensitive at all, and for most, it is close to an allergic reaction, and they burn much faster under sunlight if kept in the sun for a sustained period anaphylaxis can occur, and irreparable damage can happen to the dermis and epidermis leading to gangrene and/or loss of extremities.</li>

                <p> If you or a loved one is suspected of being exposed to Vampirn Annelida, please contact a doctor or emergency services immediately.  The more time to treat the better chance of a full recovery.  
                If you are in an area with a high population of bats, wolves, foxes or other mammalian predators keep up to date with your local watch and listen for outbreaks in your area.  If there are no reported cases in your area but you are bit by a known carrier you should still be tested for the parasite along with the normal course of antibiotics and vaccinations.

                <li>Lupenthopy is a magi-virus, the virus itself is called lupenvirus.</li>

                <li>During the three days of the centering on the full moon, those infected with lupenvirus undergo a magiphysical change from dusk until dawn hours.</li>

                    <li>the extension of physical features to be that more of the most common natural canid of the area. If there are no large apex canids where one is infected it appears the default is that of the Eurasian or gray wolf.</li>

                    <li>Increase of the olfactory bulb.</li>

                <li><strong>Fact</strong> while Lupinviris has been eradicated in most westernized countries due to vaccination efforts, you may still come into contact with a carrier, and it is best to be vaccinated to prevent any spread of the virus.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Myth</strong>: if I get a bit by a lupenthope drinking a tea made of or eating raw wolfsbane will prevent me from contracting the virus.</li>
                <li><strong>Fact</strong>: wolfsbane was once an early preventative measure.  it does kill the virus if both are active in the bloodstream at the same time. So raw wolfsbane or tea made of wolfsbane works less then 20% of the time if taken within an hour of contact with the virus. so it is not advised to treat yourself if you have come into contact with lupenvirus. If you suspect you have been in contact with the virus go to a hospital immediately- if treated with the magi-active compound in wolfsbane along with booster shots of the vaccine the rate of infection goes from 92% to 3%.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Myth</strong>: if I am bitten and I turn once I am forever cursed</li>
                <li><strong>Fact</strong>: due to recent breakthroughs individuals who have the virus, through intensive treatment, can make a recovery.  Also suppressing medication can prevent the magiphysical effects during the full moon. You can also reduce your chances of affecting others through medications and other antiviral treatments.</li>

         <ul class=a>
             <li>facts</li>
             <ul class="b">
                <li>Lycanthropy is a Human Endogenous retrovirus (HERV) that is a mutated form of lupenthopy.</li>
                <li>It presents as a recessive trait found on the x chromosome, along the magi-chromomere</li>
                <li>It is estimated that lupenthopy mutated no earlier than 15,000 years ago as it passed to the Americas over the land bridge.</li>
                <li>While it does share many traits with its grandparent it is vastly different in many more.</li>
                <li>While not all shape changers suffer from lycanthropy, the study of the genetic differences in sufferers has lead to a better understanding of many shape-changing and magiphysical conditions.</li>
                <li>Those who have lycanthropy can be taught how to control their transformation. Though the magiphysical changes are still highly connected to the fazes of the moon and the subject’s mood.</li>
                <li><strong>Magiphysical transformations</strong></li>
                 <ul class="c">
                    <li>Much like those suffering from lupenthopy those who have lycanthropy change during the three days centering around the full moon. Though unlike those with lupenthopy lycanthropes keep their memories and some of their inhibitions once they have changed.</li>
                    <li>People who have been educated may actively change from fully humanoid to completely wolf-like or many stages in between, though fine control is difficult to master.  </li>
                    <li>When semi transformed lycanthropes do tend to take on more of the animal characteristics then lycanthropes. Becoming something more akin to a bipedal canid then a true hybrid of humans and animals.</li>
                    <li>While in this state most of the sufferer’s mental faculties are kept but they may become more emotional and more likely to act upon those emotions.</li>
                    <li>Transformations have been known to occur during heightened emotional states, and in tandem with the fight/flight/freeze response</li>

                <br><li><strong>Myth</strong>:  lycanthropy needs a cure</li>
                <li><strong>Fact</strong>: this is a highly controversial area of study, while some people are searching for a cure to lycanthropy some people protest this search due to lycanthropy being a part of a religious or cultural tradition.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Myth</strong>: only x group suffers from lycanthropy</li>
                <li><strong>Fact</strong>: much like lycanthropy different types of lycanthropy can be found throughout the globe, presenting as an apex canid of the area it is found in. additionally, many non-canid transformations have been found have similar mechanisms as lycanthropy though whether they come from the same source depends on the individual disease</li>
