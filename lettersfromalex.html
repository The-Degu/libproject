               <strong>  To my friend Zovot</strong> <br> <br> 
        </H6>
            <h6>
                I do hope that this letter finds you well. While I cannot speak for the mental health of my assistants, my research is indeed going well. Your aid during your last visit was more than I could ever ask for- or that I can ever repay. I do not say this lightly when I tell you, you launched me two decades ahead of my peers. The board is still breathing down my neck to see my research, and keeping our findings a secret is becoming more difficult by the day. I do hope your own research is going more smoothly than mine. that reminds me, during my own research  I found a handful of books that I think you would enjoy. Maybe the next time I come to visit, I will bring them, or once I get the funds, I will send them to you.
            </H6>
            <h6>
                I cannot lie, I must tell you the breakthrough I had, and maybe you will have additional insight as usual. I was able to sustain a Musca domestica, a housefly, for almost three months. Eighty-five days to be exact; more than a 300% increase to the average lifespan of the insect. If I am able to replicate the results I plan on moving onto larger test subjects. Extension of life through time dilation, who would have thought it was anything more than a dream?
            </H6>
            <h6> Sol says hello as well, he is doing well his insights are, as always, ever so helpful. Some days I think I would throw him out of my lab window, but I jest; he is just as integral to our research as you or I. Well, probably more important than myself if I were to be honest. That damn serpent is smarter than all of us combined.
            </h6>
         </div><br> <br>
           <div class=sheet>
             <h6> Anyway, would you mind if I sent you a copy of my dissertation? I know you are much more, let’s say, charismatic than myself, and you can use wordplay better than the greatest politicians. If you were to let me steal some of your words, I would be very appreciative and would owe you even greater than I already do. I do know it most likely means very little to you, but I will make a point to tell all you were my right hand in our discoveries; you will revel with me in our accomplishments.  <br>
                So , with that being said, I do wish you well and hope to receive word from you soon and look forward to what you have to say.. <br></H6><h6>

                        <h6> I cannot say how overjoyed I was to hear from you, and to find that you are well. I am happy to hear you are settled into your new home. The coast is quite beautiful this time of year, and I envy you for it. The skies are much clearer there than here in the city. Do you know how long you plan on staying at your current home? I know you are not one to stay in one place for long, and that you must have your next three adventures planned even before you have finished your current one.

                        <h6>Are you off work during the holiday? If so, if it is not too much to ask, I would like to come and visit you. If I were to take the train, I could stay for a week-- though I do not wish to assume that you would be able to host me on such short notice. Maybe I can bring my research and dissertation with me, but I would not keep our time to only my boasting; I know there are plenty of other things I wish to do with you if we were to meet once again. Both Sol and Ms. Wellesley have been helping me try to write my dissertation. They both say I am too pompous, especially in the beginning- that I am demeaning the board by explaining the basics to them. Still, I think it is theatrical, I trust your opinion on it though if you feel I am being demeaning, then I will change the wording. Here is what I have so far:</h6>

                    <h6>Thank you for having me over for the holiday, but I do not think I will be writing to you again. I will no longer speak to you outside of professional contact through my secretary, unless you can swallow your pride and apologize to both Ms. Welksey and me for your childish outbursts that night. You have no say over my discoveries, and I do not think you should be the one to say what is and is not best for myself and what you called ‘the world at large.’ Your actions were that of a schoolyard bully, and I should treat you as such until you come to your senses. </h6>
                    <h6> As for your actions taken earlier in the week, I will not speak of them as long as you do not. Our mutually assured destruction will be the most likely outcome of any actions taken on that front. I trust Ms. Welksey not to mention anything either. However, her knowledge of the situation is limited and is of no concern to you. I expect you not to come to the wedding, and I will make sure that there will be security on staff to see you out if you make yourself known.
