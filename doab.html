      <h2>I don’t know why I am writing this, maybe so that I won’t be forgotten, maybe it is just to pretend I still have some autonomy left, that I can do this one thing for only myself.  My name is Marcus Bennett I was born May 9th, 1854, and I was reborn August 22, 1882.  I was dying and my wife- Emilia, saved me and ended me in one slash of a knife and a bite to the wrist.   
      </h2>
      <h2>I live in the northern compound in Madam Ruth’s territory. She comes to visit us every once in a while.  I see the way she looks at me and at Emilia the way she sneers in disgust.  She thinks that she is better than us just because she is not us.  We were once friends, now she only looks at me with pity thinking I have completely lost everything she once helped me become. She does not know what it is like being me, being us. 
      </h2>
      <h2>I guess I should explain some things instead of just vomiting words onto the page.  Make this a real story not just some rambling of someone who's lost their mind. </h2>
      <h2>I was twenty-seven when the beginning of the end started. I was working at a sanitarium,  I worked Night shifts, twelve hours six days a week. Everyone that worked there knew it was only a matter of time before we were in the beds next to our patients.  It wasn’t that I was pure of heart, it was that the pay was good and I had nothing to lose. Work has always been hard to find, sometimes you just gotta have to live with the promise of dyeing later, rather than starve to death now. </h2>
      <h2> I had been coughing for a year when I met Emilia. Bumped into her on the street after one of my shifts. I was dead on my feet and landed flat on my ass, couldn't catch my breath, and She was so worried and carried me back to the clinic.   My coworkers gave me so much shit for that but Emilia offered to get a coffee with me for my trouble, so a little ribbing was all worth it in the end.
      </h2>
      <h2>She was quite candid about her condition, telling me on our third date that she was a vampire.  It was after I told her about my TB, which is to put it lightly, a touch more difficult to hide than vampirism.  But it put my heart at ease a little bit, no one had heard of a vampire getting TB so we kind of made it work.  Plus I was dumb young and in love so it really didn’t matter to me.
      </h2>
      <h2>Once I was too sick to work anymore, Emilia moved in with me.  It was an easy decision for both of us.  She was definitely not a nurse, and still does not have a maternal bone in her body, but she takes instructions well.  I had some savings, and she was working part-time as a secretary so we were not too pressed for money.  Looking back at that time, in that tiny dingy apartment, was the happiest time in my life  and I think she was truly happy too. </h2>
      <h2>I remember that miserable summer, the suffocating heat, the sweet smell of sickness filling the air. The windows were open, trying to let in the slightest amount of breeze, and the sound of the busy street so many floors down.   Though the heat and suffocation might have just been the fever and my lungs dissolving in bacteria- hard to say really.  
      </h2>
      <h2>“Hey honey,” Emilia’s  voice smooth and rich as it always had been “here sit up, there we go”</h2>
      <h2> She smiled at me running her ever frigid hands over my forehead and down my face.  Gods I wanted to kiss her so much then, my brain the clearest it had been in weeks,  but I could barely lift my hand to meet her's. I knew then more than ever I needed to spend the rest of my life with her; No matter how short I knew it was going to be.</h2>
      <h2>So I asked her through wheezing breaths“will you marry me?”</h2>
      <h2> Looking back now I think it might have been cruel, manipulative even, but I don't think either of us regret it. Her face twisted, but she nodded and started crying, leaning into my chest.  I cried too, as I ran my fingers through her hair. We just held each other for what might have been hours, the light outside changing to a deep scarlet when Emilia started talking again. It was barely a whisper, I do not know if she wanted me to hear it, her mouth still smothered into my shirt “I want to save you”	
      </h2>
      <h2>I hummed in response, not sure what to say.  I think I was okay with dying then, I had seen so many people do it before I knew how it would be, how it would happen, drowning in my own lungs as the rest of my organs turn into sludge.  Not pleasant but I think no worse than being run over by a carriage.  
      </h2>
      <h2>“I,” she struggled to find the right words, “I could turn you.”
       </h2>
      <h2> If I had the breath I would have laughed. “That will definitely kill me.”
        </h2>
      <h2>“I know” I felt wetness on my shoulder where she pressed her face “but if it doesn't.”
      </h2>
      <h2>“Then it could cure the consumption.” I sigh. It wasn't unheard of, though it is highly illegal,  too many unknowns when turning people, plus all of the unpleasant side effects.  Most people in the general public would rather die, and even now I do not know if I regret doing what we did.  </h2>
      <h2>We sit there in the quiet for a long time. Emilia slowly sits up in bed her face red and blotchy, but her warm smile ever-present.  
       
        </h2>
      <h2> “Let's get married first” she states flatly, I see the gears moving behind her eyes “the day after tomorrow. So we have time to plan of course.”
       </h2>
      <h2> “Of course” I wheezed and grinned.</h2>
      <h2>She looked out the window and I ran my thumb over her hip. She sighs and looks down at me, smiling fully her eyes crinkling and the sun shining through her hair like a halo. She snorts and shouts  “We’ll have a party! I’ll get a judge from the statehouse,  and I'll invite our friends, and I'll get us a cake and a banquet for kings! It will be the greatest party the city has ever seen!” 
      </h2>
      <h2>“we'll dance and get drunk!” 
        </h2>
      <h2>“I’ll hire a taxi to take us out on the town! See a show!”
       </h2>
      <h2> “We’ll go to the mountains for our honeymoon.”
        </h2>
      <h2>“And we’ll make love.”
        </h2>
      <h2>“And we will have lots of babies.” 
        </h2>
      <h2>“We'll be homesteaders, with a horse.”
        </h2>
      <h2>“Can we get a dog?”
       </h2>
      <h2> “Of course we can get a dog. What would protect the horse!”
      </h2>
      <h2>  We laughed, it hurt to laugh, but we did it anyway.  We spent the rest of the night together, whispering what we will do once we are married.  How many chickens we should get, how many is too many children, what type of house we will build and how many maids we would need to clean it. </h2>
      <h2>The next day Emilia is running around the apartment and the town like a chicken with her head cut off.  I was able to get out of bed and reheat some soup. It was a very productive day for both of us.
      </h2>
      <h2>The wedding was everything I ever wanted. though as a man who had never seen himself getting married it was not exactly something difficult to do.  The officiant was an odd man but seemed to be happy to be there once the beer was flowing freely.   John Collins was my best man, and Rachel Orloc was Emilia’s maid of honor. 
      </h2>
      <h2>The other two-dozen people crammed into the apartment too small to fit half as many were friends and coworkers.   As well as Our neighbors who either hated us or joined in.   We sang, ate and drank,and we had lemon cake from the bakery down the street. someone brought a guitar and another person a trumpet. It was a party, a wedding and a wake all in one, no one slept that night,  no one cried that night, we just were.</h2>
      <h2>Looking back that was the happiest day of my life.
      </h2>
      <h2>It was no earlier than four AM when my eyes started slipping closed.  I didn’t want to sleep yet, I did not want it to be tomorrow. Emilia was sitting next to me and kissed my shoulder, she said something to the group, I didn't quite catch. I did not want it to be tomorrow, John came up to me and shook my hand, he was not one for grand gestures, but he held my hand for a long time then, he said more then he could with any words. I did not want it to be tomorrow.  Soon enough the apartment is empty and my energy with it.  Emilia still danced around doing a little bit of cleaning, I watched her as she did so. I did not want it to be tomorrow.</h2>
      <h2>She lifts her glass and said in a sing-song voice “we got drunk, danced, saw a show”
        </h2>
      <h2>I rasped  “quite the wedding if you ask me”
        </h2>
      <h2>“Yeah, the party of the century” she laughed and crawled onto my lap.  “are you ready for the honeymoon?”
        </h2>
      <h2>“I think the honeymoon will have to wait until tomorrow” I sighed. Emilia smiled at me and ran her fingers through my hair, then caress my cheek I leaned into the touch, her cold hands stiffening my fever the smallest amount. I looked up to her and smiled “but there is not time like the present.”
      </h2>
      <h2>  “You still want to try then?” 
        </h2>
      <h2>“Yes”
        </h2>
      <h2>“Okay”
        </h2>
      <h2>Emilia was still wearing her wedding gown.  Her hair was up in an ornate braid with wilting wildflowers stuck in it.  She smiled at me and ran her thumbs over my cheeks.  She took out a scalpel, John’s gift, and placed it in my hand, and held the blade with my fingers.  The cut wasn't deep, just enough for a heavy bead of crimson to run down my arm.  I watched as Emilia slowly pulled my arm to her mouth, slow enough to give me a chance to stop her. Then the warmth of her mouth pulled and pushed on my skin there. After only minute or two she pulled away looked at me and held my face with her hands, blood still wet on her lips. </h2>
      <h2>Her face was the last thing I saw before I died,  And I could not have been happier with that.  
      </h2>
      <h2>That night and the week afterward I have no memory of. At some point My fever broke onto an onslaught of cold that never left me. I think I slept a lot, probably closer to a coma than actual restful sleep. </h2>
