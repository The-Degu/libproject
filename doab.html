      <h2>I don’t know why I am writing this, maybe so that I won’t be forgotten, maybe it is just to pretend I still have some autonomy left, that I can do this one thing for only myself.  My name is Marcus Bennett I was born May 9th, 1854, and I was reborn August 22, 1882.  I was dying and my wife- Emilia, saved me and ended me in one slash of a knife and a bite to the wrist.   
      </h2>
      <h2>I live in the northern compound in Madam Ruth’s territory. She comes to visit us every once in a while.  I see the way she looks at me and at Emilia the way she sneers in disgust.  She thinks that she is better than us just because she is not us.  We were once friends, now she only looks at me with pity thinking I have completely lost everything she once helped me become. She does not know what it is like being me, being us. 
      </h2>
      <h2>I guess I should explain some things instead of just vomiting words onto the page.  Make this a real story not just some rambling of someone who's lost their mind. </h2>
      <h2>I was twenty-seven when the beginning of the end started. I was working at a sanitarium,  I worked Night shifts, twelve hours six days a week. Everyone that worked there knew it was only a matter of time before we were in the beds next to our patients.  It wasn’t that I was pure of heart, it was that the pay was good and I had nothing to lose. Work has always been hard to find, sometimes you just gotta have to live with the promise of dyeing later, rather than starve to death now. </h2>
      <h2> I had been coughing for a year when I met Emilia. Bumped into her on the street after one of my shifts. I was dead on my feet and landed flat on my ass, couldn't catch my breath, and She was so worried and carried me back to the clinic.   My coworkers gave me so much shit for that but Emilia offered to get a coffee with me for my trouble, so a little ribbing was all worth it in the end.
      </h2>
      <h2>She was quite candid about her condition, telling me on our third date that she was a vampire.  It was after I told her about my TB, which is to put it lightly, a touch more difficult to hide than vampirism.  But it put my heart at ease a little bit, no one had heard of a vampire getting TB so we kind of made it work.  Plus I was dumb young and in love so it really didn’t matter to me.
      </h2>
      <h2>Once I was too sick to work anymore, Emilia moved in with me.  It was an easy decision for both of us.  She was definitely not a nurse, and still does not have a maternal bone in her body, but she takes instructions well.  I had some savings, and she was working part-time as a secretary so we were not too pressed for money.  Looking back at that time, in that tiny dingy apartment, was the happiest time in my life  and I think she was truly happy too. </h2>
      <h2>I remember that miserable summer, the suffocating heat, the sweet smell of sickness filling the air. The windows were open, trying to let in the slightest amount of breeze, and the sound of the busy street so many floors down.   Though the heat and suffocation might have just been the fever and my lungs dissolving in bacteria- hard to say really.  
      </h2>
      <h2>“Hey honey,” Emilia’s  voice smooth and rich as it always had been “here sit up, there we go”</h2>
      <h2> She smiled at me running her ever frigid hands over my forehead and down my face.  Gods I wanted to kiss her so much then, my brain the clearest it had been in weeks,  but I could barely lift my hand to meet her's. I knew then more than ever I needed to spend the rest of my life with her; No matter how short I knew it was going to be.</h2>
      <h2>So I asked her through wheezing breaths“will you marry me?”</h2>
      <h2> Looking back now I think it might have been cruel, manipulative even, but I don't think either of us regret it. Her face twisted, but she nodded and started crying, leaning into my chest.  I cried too, as I ran my fingers through her hair. We just held each other for what might have been hours, the light outside changing to a deep scarlet when Emilia started talking again. It was barely a whisper, I do not know if she wanted me to hear it, her mouth still smothered into my shirt “I want to save you”	
      </h2>
      <h2>I hummed in response, not sure what to say.  I think I was okay with dying then, I had seen so many people do it before I knew how it would be, how it would happen, drowning in my own lungs as the rest of my organs turn into sludge.  Not pleasant but I think no worse than being run over by a carriage.  
      </h2>
      <h2>“I,” she struggled to find the right words, “I could turn you.”
       </h2>
      <h2> If I had the breath I would have laughed. “That will definitely kill me.”
        </h2>
      <h2>“I know” I felt wetness on my shoulder where she pressed her face “but if it doesn't.”
      </h2>
      <h2>“Then it could cure the consumption.” I sigh. It wasn't unheard of, though it is highly illegal,  too many unknowns when turning people, plus all of the unpleasant side effects.  Most people in the general public would rather die, and even now I do not know if I regret doing what we did.  </h2>
      <h2>We sit there in the quiet for a long time. Emilia slowly sits up in bed her face red and blotchy, but her warm smile ever-present.  
       
        </h2>
      <h2> “Let's get married first” she states flatly, I see the gears moving behind her eyes “the day after tomorrow. So we have time to plan of course.”
       </h2>
      <h2> “Of course” I wheezed and grinned.</h2>
      <h2>She looked out the window and I ran my thumb over her hip. She sighs and looks down at me, smiling fully her eyes crinkling and the sun shining through her hair like a halo. She snorts and shouts  “We’ll have a party! I’ll get a judge from the statehouse,  and I'll invite our friends, and I'll get us a cake and a banquet for kings! It will be the greatest party the city has ever seen!” 
      </h2>
      <h2>“we'll dance and get drunk!” 
        </h2>
      <h2>“I’ll hire a taxi to take us out on the town! See a show!”
       </h2>
      <h2> “We’ll go to the mountains for our honeymoon.”
        </h2>
      <h2>“And we’ll make love.”
        </h2>
      <h2>“And we will have lots of babies.” 
        </h2>
      <h2>“We'll be homesteaders, with a horse.”
        </h2>
      <h2>“Can we get a dog?”
       </h2>
      <h2> “Of course we can get a dog. What would protect the horse!”
      </h2>
      <h2>  We laughed, it hurt to laugh, but we did it anyway.  We spent the rest of the night together, whispering what we will do once we are married.  How many chickens we should get, how many is too many children, what type of house we will build and how many maids we would need to clean it. </h2>
      <h2>The next day Emilia is running around the apartment and the town like a chicken with her head cut off.  I was able to get out of bed and reheat some soup. It was a very productive day for both of us.
      </h2>
      <h2>The wedding was everything I ever wanted. though as a man who had never seen himself getting married it was not exactly something difficult to do.  The officiant was an odd man but seemed to be happy to be there once the beer was flowing freely.   John Collins was my best man, and Rachel Orloc was Emilia’s maid of honor. 
      </h2>
      <h2>The other two-dozen people crammed into the apartment too small to fit half as many were friends and coworkers.   As well as Our neighbors who either hated us or joined in.   We sang, ate and drank,and we had lemon cake from the bakery down the street. someone brought a guitar and another person a trumpet. It was a party, a wedding and a wake all in one, no one slept that night,  no one cried that night, we just were.</h2>
      <h2>Looking back that was the happiest day of my life.
      </h2>
      <h2>It was no earlier than four AM when my eyes started slipping closed.  I didn’t want to sleep yet, I did not want it to be tomorrow. Emilia was sitting next to me and kissed my shoulder, she said something to the group, I didn't quite catch. I did not want it to be tomorrow, John came up to me and shook my hand, he was not one for grand gestures, but he held my hand for a long time then, he said more then he could with any words. I did not want it to be tomorrow.  Soon enough the apartment is empty and my energy with it.  Emilia still danced around doing a little bit of cleaning, I watched her as she did so. I did not want it to be tomorrow.</h2>
      <h2>She lifts her glass and said in a sing-song voice “we got drunk, danced, saw a show”
        </h2>
      <h2>I rasped  “quite the wedding if you ask me”
        </h2>
      <h2>“Yeah, the party of the century” she laughed and crawled onto my lap.  “are you ready for the honeymoon?”
        </h2>
      <h2>“I think the honeymoon will have to wait until tomorrow” I sighed. Emilia smiled at me and ran her fingers through my hair, then caress my cheek I leaned into the touch, her cold hands stiffening my fever the smallest amount. I looked up to her and smiled “but there is not time like the present.”
      </h2>
      <h2>  “You still want to try then?” 
        </h2>
      <h2>“Yes”
        </h2>
      <h2>“Okay”
        </h2>
      <h2>Emilia was still wearing her wedding gown.  Her hair was up in an ornate braid with wilting wildflowers stuck in it.  She smiled at me and ran her thumbs over my cheeks.  She took out a scalpel, John’s gift, and placed it in my hand, and held the blade with my fingers.  The cut wasn't deep, just enough for a heavy bead of crimson to run down my arm.  I watched as Emilia slowly pulled my arm to her mouth, slow enough to give me a chance to stop her. Then the warmth of her mouth pulled and pushed on my skin there. After only minute or two she pulled away looked at me and held my face with her hands, blood still wet on her lips. </h2>
      <h2>Her face was the last thing I saw before I died,  And I could not have been happier with that.  
      </h2>
      <h2>That night and the week afterward I have no memory of. At some point My fever broke onto an onslaught of cold that never left me. I think I slept a lot, probably closer to a coma then actual restful sleep. </h2>
      <h2> 
        I  don’t really remember ever waking up, not really. Just a haze of memories that slowly lead me to stand in a jail cell my mouth filled with the taste of iron.  Once I was lucid, I asked the officers if my wife was coming, what had happened, but they just ignored me, refused to even look at me. I was in my cell alone for a long time, ‘too dangerous to let out’ they said.  It does not take a genius to know what happened, but I do not want any of those memories to come back to me. I was hungry, and there was no one there to stop me.  Well no one until madam Ruth came.
      </h2>
      <h2>Madam Ruth is a force to be reckoned with. She was a woman born over a hundred years before my turning, and stood in the front lines of several revolutions parasol on her shoulder and tinted glasses on her nose.  She wore either long mourning dresses with high colors or trousers with a mostly unbuttoned shirt. She filed her teeth to make them into points and she always carried at least one gun and two knives on her person at all times. She spoke with a buzzing accent with long Os and every other word a curse in one language or another. Her face looked like both that of a sixteen year old and a fifty year old, her eyes sharp and bright, and her skin without a single mark of damage from the sun.  she was someone who has seen the face of death and called it a bitch.
      </h2>
      <h2>She walked into the holding area, looked at me and even though she barely came up to my chest I felt very small in that moment.
      </h2>
      <h2>  “Yep he’s one of mine” she remarks to one of the guards. Her eyebrow raised as if to say ‘dont say shit’ “dumbass got bit two deccades ago, is one of those damn vegetarian types.  Always half starving himself”
     </h2>
      <h2>   “Youre lucky ruth that he didn't get his hands on-”
        </h2>
      <h2>  She swats the guards shoulder “I will take him and that will be that, we have ways of dealing with our own.”
       </h2>
      <h2> The guard swallowed and unlocked my cell, Ruth turning on her heel as soon as the gate was opened.  I followed her like a lost puppy, she has a presence about her that made me want to be around her. Similar but not the same as Emilia.  I felt safe, like she would take care of me.</h2>
      <h2>I was just pondering this when she shoved me into her car. climging in after me, saying something to the driver then looked me up and down with scrutinizing eyes.  
       </h2>
      <h2> “So who changed you and why the fuck did you just runin your life” she orders.
      </h2>
      <h2>  There was a small part of me that did not want to say anything, but something about this woman made me want to tell her everything. So I told her everything Ii’m telling you now.
       </h2>
      <h2> “Well then” Madam Ruth started and rolled her shoulders after I finished my story “It’s very illegal to change someone, but its slightly less so to be changed.  Every vamp on this side of the country reports to me.  I do not have time for your excuses, tell me the name of your wife so we can all move on with our lives.”
        </h2>
      <h2> I looked out of the window the streets passing by shame fills my gut.  My  mind fighting for the loyalty to my wife and the pull that Ruth also has over me  “uh, Emilia, Emilia is her name”</h2>
      <h2>Ruth hums but does not say anything else for the rest of what feels like a day-long car ride.  We did not stop until we pulled into what looked like a rather extravagant apartment complex, with a huge garden in the front with parasols, shady trees, and deckchairs. It would be very beautiful if not for eight foot high brick walls with razor wire lining the place. 

        </h2>
      <h2> Ruth led me inside. I had to half-jog to keep up with her brisk pace. The ground floor was a communal living space, no windows but a large fireplace and upturned slats in some of the walls that light through the breeze without letting in much sunlight.  Ruth started calling out orders in her native language, which I did not speak a word of, at that time.  Several people who were just lounging about were quick to get to their feet and do whatever order Ruth barked out.
       </h2>
      <h2> She ushered me to an office, and laid everything out.  What Emilia and I had done was bad, highly illegal. Vampirism is not something a person gives to another person,  a brain parasite that slowly turns you into a mindless killing machine.  Sure it will extend your life but the mind-altering and cannibalistic tendencies that come with are widely seen as worse than what it gives.  I was to live at the compound for ten years, as both a punishment and to make sure I did not go farel in that time.</h2>
      <h2>“You will be expected to work,” Ruth continued in her curt tone “ you may be able to go back to your previous job, if you lose it you can work on the farm, we raise pigs for our… specialty diets and sell the meat. That helps subsidize our living expenses.  You will not be expected to pay for any food, water, or housing, but any luxury items comes from your own accounts. You're free to come and go as you please, as long as you keep curfew. For safety reasons no non-vamp is allowed into the compound.  Does that all make sense?”
        
        </h2>
      <h2>“Uh- yeah” I did not understand
        </h2>
      <h2>“Okay, and also” Ruth leaned in her char her expression turning dark “while not a hard rule, you shouldnt seak out your wife, you’re obvously deeply entrawled with her-- its spilling over to me-- if you want to keep your sense of self, ya better give it some space. But that’s up to you”</h2>
      <h2>And so my life turned to some semblance of status quo. I tried to continue working at the asylum, but seeing those people, beg me to save them to do something, then John begged me as he lay in that bed. My best friend,  he asked me to save him to give to him what Emilia had given to me years before.   I tried to save him, but I watched him choke on his own lungs as he drowned in them, and as he bleed out in my arms. I didn't save him.</h2>
      <h2>No one told me what happened to Emilia, she never came to live at the Compound.  It was forty-four years later when I saw her again. I was working on the farm then, living at the Compound freely.  I was comfortable, even happy, at that point I had known the life of a vampire longer than I knew my living one.  
      </h2>
      <h2> I think it was around four am on a Tuesday. It was downpouring, sheets of rain obscuring the road I walked for my commute.  I nearly missed her by the side of the road.  She was standing on the street across from the compound just looking at it. Even in the dark and rain I knew who it was immediately,  she hadn’t aged a day, though to be fair neither did I.   
      </h2>
      <h2>“Emilia?” I called her.  Her head turned but she made no other movements.  I ran across the empty street to her.  She just looked at me with such tired, sunken eyes that I could hardly recognize her. The smell of blood flooded the air around her.  I just hovered my hands over her arms, and saw the long red stain across the front of her shirt, the blood that was once on her hands and mouth had long since washed away.  I pulled my jacket off and threw it over her shoulders and rushed her inside and up to my room.
      </h2>
      <h2>I fussed around my room, turning up the heat and the boiler-- it sputtered to life.  I took out a glass bottle and set it into a heater, its contents loosening as the heat sinks into it.   I kept an eye on Emilia as I buzzed about the room but she was quiet, just pulling my jacket close to her shoulders, her gaze only on her shoes. The blood on her shirt had washed out a long time ago, now only a red stain. She did not look like she was bleeding herself but her skin was pale and her eyes sunken.
      </h2>
      <h2>I went up to her “here there is a bathroom right down the hall, why don't you shower and warm up.  I can lend you some clean clothes. okay?”
      </h2>
      <h2>  She did not move. I looked past her and rubbed my neck “it will take a bit for the food to heat up, if you want to wait to eat first we can do it that way.”
   </h2>
      <h2>     Still no response
       </h2>
      <h2> “Please, let me know how I can help you”
        </h2>
      <h2>  Emilia pulled in a bitter breath then nodded. 
        “your shower is down there?” she asked in a horse whisper 
        </h2>
      <h2>“Yeah i’ll leave some clothes and a towel right inside the door for you. Take however long you like”</h2>
      <h2>Emilia nodded shakelly and went into the bathroom. It only took a moment for me to pull out some pajamas and a towel for her leaving it just  inside the door. Leaving me to fuss about the kitchen, I set a seckond bottle into the warmer and started some onions, sausage,  and potatoes on the stove.  The kitchen was full of the savory smells by the time I heard the water shut off.  
      </h2>
      <h2>I set a plate of the food, the warm bottle of pig’s blood and a slice of lemon cake in front of her and sat to her side, a few comfortable feet between us.  I had my own plate but I did not touch it, I could not take my eyes off of Emilia as she crammed as much food into her mouth as she could and rubbed at the tears leaking out of her eyes.  When she was done I pushed my plate towards her and she gave me something close to a smile.  
      </h2>
      <h2>Her smiles are soft, and warm.  At that moment I felt something in my chest, and there was something fighting it in my brain saying that I should have been angry, throwing things, kicking the walls, but all I wanted to do in that moment was bare my throat to her once again.  She came to me, eyes dark and sat on my lap. My brain screamed to at the very least ask ‘why?’ but I couldn't even breath as she leaned in, her familiar smell filling my every sense. Her hair became blinders focusing my everything into her.
